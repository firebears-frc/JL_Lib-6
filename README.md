# INTRODUCTION


JL_LIB is a powerful & easy to use library that uses OpenGL/OpenGLES
with SDL2.  JL_LIB takes care of any compatibility issues there might be between
opengl and opengles and sdl for all supported platforms ( any code written in
this library will run on any supported platform, no extra code writing needed ).

Supported Platforms:
* Linux ( including Raspberry Pi )
* Android

Need help porting:
* Windows PC
* Apple ( Mac )
* IOS
* Others ?

# INSTALL

1. Set up build directories & Download + Build dependencies:
	* For Android compatibility,
		make init-all --silent
	* Without,
		make init-most --silent
2. Compile Library:
	* Build for your computer,
		make build-library --silent
	* Cross compile for ...
		( TODO: TBD )
3. Set Environment Variables
	* In ~/.bashrc
		export JLL_PATH=/home/$(YOUR_NAME_HERE)/bin
		export JLL_HOME=/home/$(YOUR_NAME_HERE)/$(LIB-DIR)/JL_Lib-6

# CLEAN

__use only when you don't want to use current builds anymore!__
* Clean all build folders:
	make clean-all --silent
* Clean all dependencies:
	make clean-deps --silent
* Clean all of the build folder:
	make clean-build --silent

# HOW TO BUILD PROJECTS WITH JL_LIB

# CODE STYLE
- Indentation is with tabs [ standard length - 8 ]
- No more than 3 tabs to start a line, at that point a separate function
	is needed.
- Every function starts with a shortenned project name: JL Lib = "jl"
	Then is followed by an underscore and file name without "JL":
	"jl_mem"
	After that there's another underscore and then the description.
	"jl_mem_clr"
	We'll call "jl_mem" the __NAMESPACE__.
- Functions that are not available to user end in "__"
- Functions that are end in a-z, 1-9
- Functions available to the library user have nothing appended to them.
- Whenever a function is a parameter, it doesn't have a __NAMESPACE__.
	Instead it has a "par__" before the function parameter name.
- Each file represents a subsystem.  JLmem.c represents memory management.
- General layout of a file:
```c
/*
 * JL_lib
 * Copyright (c) 2015 Jeron A. Lau 
*/
/** \file
 * examplefile.c
 *	example description
**/

// Includes.

// Prototypes & Constants.

/** @cond **/

// Where all the static functions go.

/** @endcond **/

// Where all the global functions go - the ones that
// The person who programs has access to.

/** @cond **/

// Where all the Exported To Other Module functions go
// The ones the programmer doesn't have access to but
// can't be static.

/** @endcond **/

/***   #End of File   ***/
```
Function naming:
__Whenever there's an object being modified by functions use:__

| Term | Meaning |
| ------------- |-------------| 
| new |	create the object. |
| old |	delete the object. |
| set |	set the object's data. |
| get |	get the object's data |
| use |	start using the object. |
| off |	stop using the object. |
| rsz |	resize or redraw the object. |
| rdr |	redraw the object |
| drw |	draw the object on the screen. |
| rnl |	run the object's loop. |
| ist |	get whether it's initialized/active. |
__Subsystems Functions:__

| Term | Meaning |
| ------------- |-------------| 
| init | run when subsystem is initialized. |
| loop | run every frame. |
| resz | run when window is resized. |
| kill | run when subsystem is ready to be shutdown. |
